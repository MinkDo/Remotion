Depression refers to an experience where we feel down most of the time, called "low mood", and you have also lost interest in things you usually enjoy. We may also have changes in sleep, appetite, feeling guilty, de-motivated, and generally withdrawing from others.
A sense of feeling overwhelmed usually characterizes stress. This feeling may be due to our coping capacity being over-stretched or under pressure for too long. Some stress can help us perform our day-to-day functions; too much stress leaves us "distressed" and often exhausted.
Anxiety is a sense of fear or dread that something terrible will happen. Anxiety can be general or specific to a place, social situation, or thing (phobia). 
People usually get confused among these terms and treat them as one sometimes. They all are different; hence their treatment/measures are also different.<br>
